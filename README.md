# Hacktoberfest-team has announced this repo to be spam as they believe it is not quality. As to not waste your time, I will not be maintaining this repo, and since hacktoberfest-team has marked it as spam in their system, it will not count for one of your 5 PRs. Don't do this for hacktoberfest, do this for open-source, which was the real goal of what Hacktoberfest once set out to do.
